# Analects Data

A compliment to [Analects](http://github.com/plexus/analects), the Ruby library for Chinese language processing. This repository serves two purposes. It is a backup of the data sources that Analects knows about, in case any of them go offline.

It also serves as a source for downloading data, for those cases where automatic downloading is difficult to achieve.

All data here is available under a license that allows distribution, and is included unaltered.
